    <h2> ME, MYSELF AND I</h2>
        <h3>PANDEMIC EDITION</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> At the start of this year I had secured a new job in VR Gaming.<br>
            I couldn't have been more excited. <br><br>
            Then, like most of the world, my plans were thrown into disarray with the arrival of COVID.<br>
            My new job offer was withdrawn. <br><br>
            In July my contract with NBC was terminated after 31/2 years. <br>
            As a PAYE Contractor I was ineligible for furlough. <br><br>
            I was unemployed. I was lost. <br><br>
            This year to date, I have applied for over 200 jobs.<br> 
            I've redone my CV several times.<br><br>
            This process has definitely knocked my confidence<br>
            However, when life throws us a curveball we have to find new ways to dodge it.<br><br>
            I have wanted to learn to code for a long time, but had never been in a position to do so.<br><br>
            When I saw the note from my job coach for this course on my Job seekers diary. <br>
            I felt like it was fate.<br><br>
            So I applied. I was accepted and that is how I came to be a student with Code Nation. <br><br>
            I cannot tell you how grateful I have been for this opportunity and how nice <br>
            it has been to reconnect with other human beings after 9 months of being at home.<br><br>
            Especially after spending 5 of those months unemployed.</p>
